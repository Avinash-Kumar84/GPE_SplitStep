Evolution of a quantum gas in time varying potential

This file contains python scrips to calculate the zero temperature ground state and time evolution of a Bose Einstein condensate in a time varying potential in 2D. The equation used is zero temperature Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the numerical computation is done using split-step FFT method.
The code is clearly written and can be easily modified for the case of phase imprinting, out of equilibrium dynamics in static or time varying potential.

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it.

Ongoing: Presently work is going on 
- making the computation faster.
- extend it to 1D and 3D
- keeping track of properties by adding operators at time steps (Kinetic energy, potential energy , angular momentum, <r^2>)

Any comments, suggestions are welcome
